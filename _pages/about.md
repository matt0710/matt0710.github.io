Hello, I am Matteo Attimonelli, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence as part of the National Ph.D. Program at Sapienza University of Rome. I am based at the Polytechnic University of Bari within the [Information Systems Research Group (SisInfLab)](https://sisinflab.poliba.it/), lead by Prof. Tommaso Di Noia.

As a passionate enthusiast of Deep Learning, I have actively engaged in Research and Development (R&D) activities within the academic realm, contributing to university projects and a research internship in the [INFSYS Lab](https://www.aau.at/en/aics/research-groups/infsys/), supervised by Prof. Dietmar Jannach. Furthermore, I've had the opportunity to work in a company, contributing to the development of Deep Learning solutions for Computer Vision and Recommender Systems domains.

Currently, my primary research focuses on Generative Artificial Intelligence, Multimodal Deep Learning,  and Recommender Systems.
