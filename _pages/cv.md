Passionate of Generative AI, Deep Computer Vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Recommender Systems and Robotics.


Work experience
======

### Research Internship 
* **University:** [INFSYS Lab](https://www.aau.at/en/aics/research-groups/infsys/) @ Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt, Austria
* **Period:** Apr 2023 - Jul 2023
* **Description:** During my internship, I conducted research supervised by Prof. Dietmar Jannach, focusing on complementary recommendation in the fashion domain. The main objective was to develop an outfit recommender system capable of suggesting compatible combinations of fashion items, even if they have never been seen together before. I explored various Generative AI approaches, including GANs, Stable Diffusion, and Masked Generative Transformers models. Additionally, I completed my Master's Thesis under the joint supervision of Prof. Dietmar Jannach and Prof. Tommaso Di Noia.

### Machine Learning Engineer
* **Company:** [Wideverse](https://www.wideverse.com/), Italy
* **Period:** Apr 2022 - Oct 2023
* **Description:** As an R&D Machine Learning Engineer, my focus lay in solving challenges related to Deep Computer Vision and Deep Recommender Systems in industrial scenarios. I collaborated with researchers and PhD students from the SisInfLab research group at the Polytechnic University of Bari, focusing on 2D and 3D Object Detection as well as Multimodal Recommender Systems.

### Research Collaborator 
* **University:** [SisInfLab](https://sisinflab.poliba.it/) @ Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy
* **Period:** Mar 2022 - Oct 2023
* **Description:** My research focused on Deep Learning and Recommender Systems within the domain of adversarial machine learning, multimodal recommender systems, and deep reinforcement learning recommender systems, supervised by Prof. Tommaso Di Noia.
